/*
Wkit provides a toolkit for the creation of a Warp9 object server that allows
for the creation of a dynamic adjustable namespace of a hierarchical set of objects.

The namespace allows for bind points to be added into the hierarchy that can
support union object trees.  Each bind point can contain a stackable set of
object trees with the option of presening a union view of the set.
