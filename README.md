# Warp9

Warp9 provides a development framework for developing services that share and consume network based resources.

The fundamental paradigm of Warp9 is:

- represent resources as a collection of objects
- create a simple consistent access method to interact with those objects
- organize the objects in a hierarchical namespace
- allow namespaces to be highly configurable and dynamic
- connect all resources via a simple remote access protocol over a reliable network

The framework will provide a set of types, functions, daemons to allow the development of resource providers and resource consumers.
